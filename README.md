# Using Api Key Authentication in Dotnet

This project is a boilerplate for implementing api key authentication in dotnet web api's and minimal api's....


### What is an Api Key Authentcation System?

The Api key method is method of authenticating an application that communicates or access an api without the need to reference an actual user. 


### How it works?

An API or an application sends a request containing an api key to another api that recieves the requests and use the api key for identification, authorization and sends a response back.

API keys identity the application or the api and not the user.
